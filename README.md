# UEFA Refereeing Assistance Programme

An application used to educate football referees based on data from UEFA.

# Description

Since 2019 UEFA has been no longer publishing its application for Refereeing Assistance Programme and that is why i I've made a decision to create my own project based on UEFA's idea.


Application is in Polish language because at first I wanted to publish for the use of Polish referees.


In the not to distant future I want to add English language.

# Technologies

Application is build with HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.


Videos, images and translations are downloaded from API that I created on Heroku.
